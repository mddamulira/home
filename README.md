# Welcome to the webpage of Mahadi Ddamulira.
Effective November 2020 I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the research group of [Prof. Dr. Joël Ouaknine](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~joel) at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems ([MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/)), Saarbrücken, Germany.

Previously, I was a University Project Assistant (PraeDoc and PostDoc) at the [Institute of Analysis and Number Theory](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/azt/home/), Graz University of Technology ([TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/)) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Robert F. Tichy](http://finanz.math.tugraz.at/~tichy/)).  I was funded by the Austrian Science Fund ([FWF](https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/)) projects: F5510, which is part of the special research program ([SFB](http://www.sfb-qmc.jku.at/)) "Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods: Theory and Applications" , P26114, with the title "Diophantine Problems: Analytic, geometric and computational aspects" and W1230 which is the "[Doctoral Program Discrete Mathematics](https://www.math.tugraz.at/discrete/index.php?link=projects&link2=9)". 

Currently, my research is devoted to topics from Diophantine equations which involve holonomic sequences and linearly recurrent sequences such as Fibonacci numbers, Lucas numbers, Pell numbers and the k-generalized Fibonacci numbers.
