# Welcome to the webpage of Mahadi Ddamulira.
Effective November 2020 I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the research group of Prof. Dr. Joël Ouaknine at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS), Saarbrücken, Germany.

Previously, I was a University Project Assistant (PraeDoc and PostDoc) at the Institute of Analysis and Number Theory, Graz University of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Robert F. Tichy.  I was funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) projects: F5510, which is part of the special research program (SFB) "Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods: Theory and Applications" , P26114, with the title "Diophantine Problems: Analytic, geometric and computational aspects" and W1230 which is the "Doctoral Program Discrete Mathematics". 

Currently, my research is devoted to topics from Diophantine equations which involve holonomic sequences and linearly recurrent sequences such as Fibonacci numbers, Lucas numbers, Pell numbers and the k-generalized Fibonacci numbers.
